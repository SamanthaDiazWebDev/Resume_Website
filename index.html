			<summary> My Childhood </summary> 
            <p><img src="MePic.jpg" width="200px" alt=Samantha Diaz></p><br>
			<p>I grew up in Brooklyn NY. I've lived in the city most of my life and cannot imagine my life outside the city. I wish to see more of the world and visit places I've only dreamed of. When I was little I always wanted to be a vet but as I grew up my love for coding grew as well but I never thought it was something I could do as a job. I never believed in myself which led me to go towards an easy path rather than work towards the future I want. Now here I am at 22 starting over and enjoying every second of putting time in for myself. Enjoy your stay on my page and check out some of my projects!</p>
